__Gemma M0 Demo__

This is a reworked stripped-down version of the original Gemma M0 Demo. Only the standard built-in libraries are needed.  

CircuitPython was only at version 2.0.0 when the Gemma M0 was originally shipped. After upgrading to CircuitPython 9.2.7, the corresponding new libraries didn't seem to fit.
(This was my first time trying CircuitPython. So it could have easily been operator error instead.) 
With Grok's help driving the DotStar RGB LED, we created this straight-forward minimalist version that demonstrates the onboard DotStar, touch sensing, and onboard red LED.
